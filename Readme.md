#Myo Guitar
###EngHack Winter 2015

Myo Guitar is an Android app that connects to a Myo Armband via bluetooth, and shows guitar frets on  the screen that you can touch and then strum using the Myo. Our app has smart chord detection so that when you play certain chords, the lower one/two strings are not strummed, e.g. D (top two strings are ignored), C, A, Am, B, Bm (top string is ignored), etc.
